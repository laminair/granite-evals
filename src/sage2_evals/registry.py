"""Benchmark interface and registry.

Every benchmark is one class registered under a stable id (e.g.
``swebench-verified``). The id is what granite.build step templates pass to
``sage2-evals run``, and what the suite files in ``sage2_evals/suites`` list.

Phases. A ``splittable`` benchmark runs as two jobs on one output dir, so no
job holds a GPU it does not use: ``--phase generate`` serves the model and
saves its outputs (the benchmark's own per-example files, which resume already
reads), ``--phase score`` serves nothing and grades them (tests, verifiers,
paid judges) on CPU. ``--phase all`` (the default) does both in one job. The
score phase never generates: a missing generation is a failed example, not a
call to a model that is not there.
