"""COMET scoring for wmt24pp, run by the image's COMET env (``/opt/comet``).

``python comet_score.py <spec.json>``. The spec (written by
``nemo_skills_g5.WMT24pp``) names ns's own scorer module
(``nemo_skills/evaluation/evaluator/comet.py``, loaded by file path: the COMET
env has no nemo_skills), the local COMET model dir, the precision, the batch
size and the ``[input, output]`` files to score. Each file goes through ns's
``process_file`` (all visible GPUs; adds ``comet`` to every row and writes
``<output>.done``).

One departure from ns's ``load_comet_model``: the checkpoint is loaded with
``reload_hparams=True, local_files_only=True`` so the encoder's config and
tokenizer come from the pinned local snapshot the run downloaded (the model's
``hparams.yaml`` there points at it), not from the hub at its head. The weights
are the checkpoint's, as in ns.

Only the standard library is imported at the top: this file lives in the
sage2_evals package but runs in an env that has none of its dependencies.
Lightning's multi-GPU launcher reruns this script once per extra GPU; every rank
reads the same spec, so all ranks score the same files.
